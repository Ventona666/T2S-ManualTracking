# T2S-ManualTracking
A simple algorithm to take manual control in case of our server or network failure.

### The purpose of this algorithm
Normally, our server retrieves the match data from an external source and transmits the transformed data to the tablets. If for any reason, the network or our server is down or the data cannot be retrieved from our external source, we need to have an algorithm to take control over this system.
